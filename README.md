# virtual-dom

A lightweight virtual DOM implementation.

### Completed

* Virtual DOM representation with the ability to make simple updates

### In Progress

* Setting element attributes (props) and diffing/updating them
* Handling events on elements
* Making our Virtual DOM work with components, like React
* Getting references to real DOM nodes
* Using Virtual DOM with libraries that directly mutate real DOM — like jQuery and its plugins
